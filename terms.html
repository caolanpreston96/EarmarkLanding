        <div class="warning-box">
            <strong style="color:#F59E0B;">Important Disclaimer:</strong> earmarkIQ provides financial <em>information</em> and <em>insights</em>, not regulated financial advice. We are not authorised or regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) to provide financial advice. You should consult a qualified financial advisor before making significant financial decisions. We do not guarantee that following our insights or recommendations will result in financial gain.
        </div>

        <h2>4. Accounts and Registration</h2>
        <h3>4.1 Account Creation</h3>
        <p>You must register an account to use earmarkIQ. You agree to provide accurate, current, and complete information during registration and to keep your account information updated.</p>

        <h3>4.2 Account Security</h3>
        <p>You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your login credentials. You agree to notify us immediately of any unauthorised access to your account. We are not liable for any loss arising from your failure to secure your account.</p>

        <h3>4.3 One Account Per Person</h3>
        <p>Each person may only maintain one earmarkIQ account. We reserve the right to terminate duplicate accounts.</p>

        <h2>5. Open Banking</h2>
        <h3>5.1 Consent</h3>
        <p>By connecting your bank account, you consent to earmarkIQ accessing your transaction data through an FCA-regulated Open Banking provider. This access is read-only — we cannot initiate payments or modify your accounts.</p>

        <h3>5.2 Bank Authentication</h3>
        <p>You authenticate directly with your bank. We never receive, see, or store your bank login credentials (username, password, PIN).</p>

        <h3>5.3 Revoking Access</h3>
        <p>You can revoke Open Banking access at any time through:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Your bank's app or online banking</li>
            <li>The earmarkIQ app settings</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Revoking access will limit the functionality of the App, as we will no longer receive updated transaction data.</p>

        <h3>5.4 Data Accuracy</h3>
        <p>We rely on data provided by your bank through Open Banking. We are not responsible for incorrect, delayed, or missing transaction data from your bank.</p>

        <h2>6. Subscription and Payments</h2>
        <h3>6.1 Free Tier</h3>
        <p>earmarkIQ offers a free tier with limited features. Free features may change at our discretion.</p>

        <h3>6.2 Premium Subscription</h3>
        <p>Premium features are available through a paid subscription at £4.99/month (or such other price as may be displayed in the App at the time of purchase). Subscriptions are billed through Apple's App Store or Google Play.</p>

        <h3>6.3 Billing</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Subscriptions automatically renew monthly unless cancelled at least 24 hours before the renewal date</li>
            <li>Payment is charged to your App Store / Google Play account</li>
            <li>You can manage or cancel your subscription through your device's app store settings</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>6.4 Refunds</h3>
        <p>Refunds are handled by Apple or Google in accordance with their respective refund policies. We do not process refunds directly.</p>

        <h3>6.5 Free Trials</h3>
        <p>We may offer free trials of Premium features. At the end of a trial, your subscription will automatically convert to a paid subscription unless cancelled before the trial ends.</p>

        <h2>7. Marketplace and Affiliate Links</h2>
        <h3>7.1 Third-Party Products</h3>
        <p>Our Smart Marketplace displays financial products from third-party providers (savings accounts, ISAs, insurance, energy deals, etc.). These products are provided by independent companies, not by earmarkIQ.</p>

        <h3>7.2 Affiliate Commissions</h3>
        <p>Some marketplace links are affiliate links. If you click through and sign up for a product, we may receive a commission from the provider. This does not cost you anything extra. Products are recommended based on relevance to your financial profile, not commission value.</p>

        <h3>7.3 No Endorsement</h3>
        <p>The inclusion of a product in our marketplace does not constitute an endorsement. You are responsible for reviewing the terms, conditions, and suitability of any financial product before signing up. We are not a party to any agreement between you and a third-party provider.</p>

        <h2>8. AI Features</h2>
        <h3>8.1 AI Insights and Chat</h3>
        <p>earmarkIQ uses artificial intelligence to generate financial insights and power the chat feature. AI-generated content is for informational purposes only and should not be treated as professional financial advice.</p>

        <h3>8.2 Accuracy</h3>
        <p>While we strive for accuracy, AI-generated insights may contain errors, be incomplete, or not account for your full financial circumstances. Always verify important financial information independently.</p>

        <h3>8.3 No Liability</h3>
        <p>We are not liable for any financial decisions you make based on AI-generated content within the App.</p>

        <h2>9. Referral Programme</h2>
        <p>earmarkIQ may offer a referral programme where users can earn free Premium months by referring new users. We reserve the right to modify, suspend, or terminate the referral programme at any time. Abuse of the referral system (e.g., creating fake accounts) will result in account termination and forfeiture of rewards.</p>

        <h2>10. Acceptable Use</h2>
        <p>You agree not to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Use the App for any unlawful purpose, including money laundering or fraud</li>

        <h2>13. Service Availability</h2>
        <p>We aim to keep earmarkIQ available at all times but do not guarantee uninterrupted service. We may suspend the service for maintenance, updates, or circumstances beyond our control. We will try to give reasonable notice of planned downtime.</p>

        <h2>14. Account Termination</h2>
        <h3>14.1 By You</h3>
