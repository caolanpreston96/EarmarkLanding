        <div class="highlight-box">
            <strong style="color:#FFFFFF;">Summary:</strong> We use Open Banking (read-only) to analyse your spending and help you manage your money. We never move your money, sell your data, or share your transactions with third parties. You can delete your data at any time.
        </div>

        <h2>1. Who We Are</h2>
        <p>earmarkIQ ("we", "us", "our") is a personal finance application operated by Caolan Preston, trading as earmarkIQ, registered in England. Our registered address is available on request.</p>
        <p>For the purposes of the UK General Data Protection Regulation (UK GDPR) and the Data Protection Act 2018, we are the data controller.</p>
        <p><strong>Contact:</strong> <a href="mailto:privacy@earmarkiq.app">privacy@earmarkiq.app</a></p>

        <h2>2. What Data We Collect</h2>

            <li>Full name</li>
            <li>Email address</li>
            <li>Password (stored securely using bcrypt hashing — we never store plaintext passwords)</li>
            <li>Monthly income (self-reported, used for allocation suggestions)</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>2.2 Bank Transaction Data (via Open Banking)</h3>
        <p>When you connect your bank account, we access your transaction data through FCA-regulated Open Banking providers. This includes:</p>

            <li>Account balances</li>
            <li>Transaction categories assigned by your bank</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="highlight-box">
            <strong style="color:#4AEDC4;">Important:</strong> We use Account Information Service Provider (AISP) access only. This is <strong>read-only</strong> — we can never initiate payments, move money, or modify your accounts. You authenticate directly with your bank; we never see your banking credentials.
        </div>

        <h3>2.3 Data You Provide</h3>

            <li>Push notification tokens (for delivering notifications)</li>
            <li>IP address (for security purposes)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>4. AI Processing</h2>
        <p>We use AI (powered by Anthropic's Claude) to analyse your transaction data and provide personalised financial insights. When you use the AI chat feature:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Your transaction data is sent to Anthropic's API for analysis</li>
            <li>Anthropic does not retain your data for training purposes</li>
            <li>AI responses are generated in real-time and not stored by Anthropic</li>
            <li>We store your chat history so you can reference past conversations</li>
        </ul>
        <p>No automated decisions with legal or similarly significant effects are made about you without human involvement.</p>

        <h2>5. Who We Share Data With</h2>

        <h2>6. Affiliate Disclosure</h2>
        <p>Our Smart Marketplace features product recommendations from financial service providers. Some of these are affiliate links — if you click through and sign up, we may receive a commission from the provider. This does not cost you anything extra.</p>
        <p>Recommendations are ranked by relevance to your financial profile, not by commission amount. We clearly label affiliate links with an "Affiliate" badge.</p>

        <h2>7. Data Security</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Encryption in transit:</strong> All data transmitted between your device and our servers uses TLS 1.2+ (HTTPS)</li>
            <li><strong>Encryption at rest:</strong> Your data is encrypted at rest in our database</li>
            <li><strong>Password security:</strong> Passwords are hashed using bcrypt with salt — we cannot read your password</li>
            <li><strong>Bank credentials:</strong> We never receive, store, or have access to your bank login details. Authentication happens directly with your bank via Open Banking</li>
            <li><strong>Access controls:</strong> Only authorised personnel can access production systems</li>
            <li><strong>FSCS protection:</strong> Your bank deposits remain protected up to £85,000 — we don't hold your funds</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>8. Data Retention</h2>

        <h2>12. International Transfers</h2>
        <p>Your data is primarily stored on servers in the EU/UK. Where data is processed outside the UK (e.g., AI processing via Anthropic's US-based servers), we ensure appropriate safeguards are in place, including Standard Contractual Clauses approved by the ICO.</p>

        <h2>13. Cookies and Tracking</h2>
        <p>Our mobile app does not use cookies. Our website (earmarkiq.app) uses only essential cookies required for the website to function. We do not use advertising cookies or tracking pixels.</p>

        <h2>14. Changes to This Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update this privacy policy from time to time. We will notify you of material changes via email or in-app notification. Continued use of the app after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.</p>
